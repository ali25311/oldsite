      <h1>Hey, I'm Ali Hussain</h1>
      <p id="text_bubbles">
        Hey there! I'm Ali and I'm a senior year university student (attending
        Cal State Fullerton) that's majoring in computer science. I am currently
        looking for an internship by the summer of 2022 related to software
        development, computer security, and/or computer science in general.
      </p>
      <p id="text_bubbles">
        I was born and raised in southern California and first went to
        Saddleback College after graduating high school. Four years later, I
        transfered to Cal State Fullerton and started attending in Fall 2020. I
        spend my free time playing video-games, self-learning about different
        programming langauges/topics, and spending time with my family.
      </p>
