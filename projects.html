          <h2><em>COVID-19 Dashboard</em></h2>
          <p>This project is based on a COVID-19 React web app tutorial made by Colby Fayock. This app is a dynamic COVID-19 dashboard that displays various statistics and information regarding COVID-19 cases across the world using tables, charts and maps.
          <br><br>
          Map functionality and overall site interactivity can be accredited to the original tutorial, which utilized Gatsby and (React)Leaflet. MaterialUI was used for the tables, as well as ChartJS for the graphs/charts.

            <h2><em>Who Would Win?</em></h2>
            <p>This project was made in collabration with 3 other classmates for our first class project in Front-End web development. Who Would Win is a fun online application where you can vote on the most epic, weird, or hysterical combinations of characters. We utilized Next.js (a React framework) as the primary foundation of our product. <br>
                <br>
            This allowed us to structure our project into components and pages, each having their own JSX markup (HTML-like syntax used in React projects). From there, each subsequent component and page had their own corresponding styling. Scripting was done through JavaScript, which was embedded within our components. We utilized Google Firestore for our database functionality, which features two collections.

            <p>This project was made in collabration with several other classmates for our semester long project in Software Engineering. Titan Types is a typing test website designed to test your words per minute using various quotes generated from an API. This website features stats like words missed, accuracy percentage, highlighting incorrect letters, and much more.
            This website mainly uses JS, jQuery and HTML/CSS.

            <h2><em>Matrix Calculator</em></h2>
            <p>Within this project, I worked with two other individuals to create a fully functional matrix calculator. This calculator is capable of performing basic matrix operations such as matrix addition, matrix subtraction, while concurrently being capable of more complex operations such as matrix inversion and matrix multiplication. To turn this idea of ours into a reality, we utilized various technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, with the entirety of the project being developed in VSCode.

            <p>Self-assigned Tic Tac Toe project that is meant to incorporate various topics from OOP/CS1B/Intermediate programming classes as a means to learn them. Developed in C++ that utilizes the command console to develop a simplistic GUI. Features a ‘smart’ AI opponent, a tally of wins/losses/ties, high-score saving, and error-proof input checking.
